Bangalore House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Introduction
Welcome to the Bangalore House Price Prediction project! This repository contains code and resources for predicting house prices in Bangalore using machine learning. The project aims to provide accurate price predictions based on various features such as location, size, total square feet, number of bathrooms, and more.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: Bengaluru House Price Data. It includes a variety of features that are crucial for predicting house prices.

Project Workflow
The project follows the steps below:

Data Collection: Obtaining the dataset from Kaggle.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting categorical features to numeric, scaling features, and detecting and removing outliers.

Feature Engineering: Converting and extracting features to enhance model performance.

Model Building: Training multiple regression models to predict house prices.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE and R².

Models Used
Several regression models are implemented in this project:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regression

Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the models is assessed using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared (R²)

Results
The results section compares the performance of different models and identifies the best-performing model for predicting house prices in Bangalore.

Conclusion
This section summarizes the findings and suggests potential improvements for future work.

Future Work
Future enhancements may include exploring additional features, trying different models, and improving preprocessing and feature engineering steps.
